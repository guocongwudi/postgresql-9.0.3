Proj Report
Test 1:
    number of buffer pools: 3
    number of buffers in each pool: 16 in each pool
    strategy for allocating pages to pools: Z
    query: select max(id) from People
    buffer pool start state: cold
    log: log_Q1_Z_cold
    
Expect:
    1)The buffer state is read_only for all the buffers, because the start state is cold.
    2)Requested buffers are in the same pool number, as in Z strategy the requested relation is the same one.
    3)The id column has been indexed, so only a few request for the db, loop the whole table is not needed. 
    
Outcome:

===
QRY explain (analyze, buffers, format yaml) select max(id) from People;
===
REQ people_pkey 0 1 17 read_only
REQ people_pkey 3 1 18 read_only
REQ people_pkey 6 1 19 read_only
REQ people 26 1 20 read_only
Explain:
The outcome fit the expect.


Test 2:

number of buffer pools: 3
number of buffers in each pool: 16 in each pool
strategy for allocating pages to pools: Y
query: 
explain (analyze, buffers, format yaml) select given||' '||family as name
from   People
where  birthday = (select min(birthday) from People);
buffer pool start state: cold
log: log_Q2_Y_cold

Expect:

1) Loop table needed.
2) As the Strategy is to put one relation in one buffer pool, and the pool size is pretty small, so the Shared Hit Blocks is limitted
Outcome:
     Shared Hit Blocks: 1                       +
     Shared Read Blocks: 53 
Explain:

The outcome fit the expect.


Test 3:

number of buffer pools: 3
number of buffers in each pool: 1000 in each pool
strategy for allocating pages to pools: Y
query: 
explain (analyze, buffers, format yaml) select given||' '||family as name
from   People
where  birthday = (select min(birthday) from People);
buffer pool start state: cold
log: log_Q2_Y_cold_largePool

Expect:

1) Loop table needed.
2) The Shared Read Blocks number equal to Shared Hit Blocks number
Outcome:
    Shared Hit Blocks: 27                      +
    Shared Read Blocks: 27
Explain:

The outcome fit the expect.


Test 4:

number of buffer pools: 5
number of buffers in each pool: 32 in each pool
strategy for allocating pages to pools: Y
query: 
explain (analyze, buffers, format yaml) 
select c.code, p.family||', '||p.given as name, e.mark, sum(a.mark)
from   People p, Courses c, Enrolments e, Items i, Assessments a
where  p.id = e.student and e.course = c.id and i.course = c.id
       and a.student = p.id and a.item = i.id
       group  by c.code, p.family, p.given, e.mark
       order  by c.code, p.family;
buffer pool start state: cold
log: log_Q2_Y_cold_largePool

Expect:

1) As the join constrain are foreign keys, so a large numbers of bolcks can be hit.
Outcome:
         Shared Hit Blocks: 84737                                               
         Shared Read Blocks: 137
Explain:

The outcome fit the expect.
